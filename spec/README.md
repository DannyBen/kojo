Tests
==================================================

Testing is done with `rspec`.

Instead of testing each unit separately, full test coverage is achieved by
executing examples and verifying the output against pre-approved output
captured by [RSpec Fixtures][1]

Run tests with either of these commands:

    $ run spec
    $ rspec
